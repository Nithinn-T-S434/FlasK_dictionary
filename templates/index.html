    <h4>About DevOps</h4>
    <p >DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development and IT operations. It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. DevOps is an approach that promotes collaboration between software developers, quality assurance teams, and IT operations teams to streamline and automate the software delivery process.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The main goal of DevOps is to increase the speed of software delivery without sacrificing quality or reliability. By utilizing automation, continuous integration, and continuous delivery (CI/CD) tools, DevOps teams can create a culture of collaboration and communication that enables faster time-to-market and improved customer satisfaction.
       <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DevOps is also about breaking down the traditional barriers between development and operations teams, and fostering a culture of continuous improvement and learning. It is a cultural shift that requires teams to work together to optimize the entire software development lifecycle, from planning and development to deployment and monitoring.

    <h1>About this Project</h1>
    <br>
    <p>This project is made to study the various techniques of devops principles ,the pipeline for automating this website consist of AWS ec2,jenkins,docker, nginx and GitHub </p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="{{url_for('static', filename='Pipeline Structure.jpg')}}" width="850" height="550"></p>
    <h5>1.Github</h5>
    <p>GitHub, Inc. is an Internet hosting service for software development and version control using Git. It provides the distributed version control of Git plus access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project</p>
    <h5>2.jenkins</h5>
    <p>Jenkins is an open-source automation tool written in Java with plugins built for continuous integration. Jenkins is used to build and test your software projects continuously making it easier for developers to integrate changes to the project, and making it easier for users to obtain a fresh build. It also allows you to continuously deliver your software by integrating with a large number of testing and deployment technologies.
        With Jenkins, organizations can accelerate the software development process through automation. Jenkins integrates development life-cycle processes of all kinds, including build, document, test, package, stage, deploy, static analysis, and much more.</p>
    <h5>3.AWS and AWS EC2</h5>
    <p>Amazon Web Services, Inc. is a subsidiary of Amazon that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered, pay-as-you-go basis.<br>Amazon EC2 is a cloud computing platform that can be auto-scaled to to meet demand.<br>

Different hardware and software configurations can be selected. Different geographical locations can be selected be closer to users, as well as providing redundancy in case of failures.<br>

Persistent storage can be provided by Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Storage). Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) data can also be accessed with Amazon EC2 instances, and is free if they are in the same region.</p>
    <h5>4.Docker</h5>
    <p>Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Dockerâ€™s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.</p>
    <h5>5.NGINX</h5>
    <p>NGINX is open source software for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and more. It started out as a web server designed for maximum performance and stability. In addition to its HTTP server capabilities, NGINX can also function as a proxy server for email (IMAP, POP3, and SMTP) and a reverse proxy and load balancer for HTTP, TCP, and UDP servers.</p>
